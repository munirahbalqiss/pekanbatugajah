            <h2> History of Batu Gajah </h2>
            <p>"Lucky City Elephant Stone". This fortunate city is the birthplace of His Majesty the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Azlan Shah Muhibbuddin Ibni Almarhum Sultan Yussuf Izzuddin Shah Ghafarullahu-Lah , a Sultan of caliber, who was once the 9th Chief Justice . His Majesty is the first Batu Gajah Figure featured in the book Batu Gajah Figures, Perak. Batu Gajah has produced many other prominent figures such as Raja Asal, William Kellie Smith, Ho Yuk Phooi, Charles Alma Baker, Kerani Ariff, Dato' Mustapha Albakri, Syed Shaidali and K. Malaiperumal Pillay . Famous names in the field of religion include Tuan Syed Abdul Kadir (First Kadi of Batu Gajah) , Haji Salleh bin Lebai Awang (Chief Imam of the Mosque) , Haji Abdul Hamid (Religious Teacher), Mohamad Nawawi (journalist and Arabic scholar) and Cikgu Ali (Quran teacher and Imam) . There are many other famous figures in all fields of prominence such as mining, rubber, administration and education.</p>

            <h2> Villages Development </h2>
            <p>Malay villages have existed in Batu Gajah since the 19th century. At that time the Malays were active in tin mining activities. There are many Chinese working in mining areas owned by Malays. It was tin that brought the Chinese to Batu Gajah. The opening of rubber plantations brought Indians here. It is clear that the development of the history of Batu Gajah is the same as the development of Malaysian History as a whole. As if Batu Gajah is 'Malaysia in Maniature'.

            <br>In Batu Gajah there are multiracial residents, namely Malays (from tribes such as Mendailing, Rawa, Talu, Acheh, Javanese and others), Chinese, Indian, Ceylon, Punjabi, Persian, Arab and others. It is not surprising that the people of Batu Gajah can understand and adapt to the lifestyle of various races so that they can create a peaceful atmosphere.</p>

        <div class="text-box">
            <h2> Related to Mining </h2>
            <p>Since the 1880s, Batu Gajah has been a meeting place for the dignitaries of Malaya at that time. In Batu Gajah at that time there was a Race Course. Horses come from Pahang and Johor to race here. There is a club where government officials and state dignitaries meet and relax. In this sense, Batu Gajah has been known since the 1880s. According to the available evidence, Batu Gajah existed around the 1870s. According to the diary of JWW Birch, the First British Resident in Perak, he visited Batu Gajah on 30 April 1875. He mentioned Batu Gajah as a large village by the Kinta River and there was a large furnace for smelting tin.
                <br>
                <br>This shows that the early development of Batu Gajah is closely related to the tin mining activities that began to develop in the Kinta Colony at that time.</p>

        <div class="text-box">
            <h2> Origin of the "Batu Gajah" name </h2>
            <p> Several versions have been reported about the origin of the name Batu Gajah. According to the first version, when tin was first found in Batu Gajah, many foreign traders from Sumatra came through the Kinta River to trade tin. They are mostly Buddhists who worship idols. Because the place has not yet been named, they have carved two large stones on the banks of the Kinta River resembling two elephant tail shapes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Then the second version, tin miners have found stones as big as elephants and as hard as an elephant's head. The miners then named the area 'Batu Gajah' (Big Rock).
                <br>
                <br>
                According to another version, which may be more credible , the name Batu Gajah is taken from the name of a village Mandailing in Medan, Indonesia. The village still exists. Regardless of the version, it should be stated here that elephants are not something foreign to the Malays. This largest land animal has been widely used for land transport in the Malay states until the early 1910s. In the Perak Royal Parade, the elephant team carrying the rengga (seat on the back of the elephant) is usually colorfully decorated, accompanied by the beautifully dressed juak-juak (biduanda) carrying royal equipment and umbrellas. In addition, elephants are also used in logging and transporting produce and mining tools in Kinta District. </p>
